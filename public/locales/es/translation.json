I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React, always striving to optimize performance and accessibility.\n\nMy approach goes beyond code: I'm interested in building digital experiences that connect with people and bring real business value. I've worked on projects where attention to detail and the ability to creatively solve problems made a difference.\n\nI'm motivated to learn and experiment with new technologies, maintaining a modular and scalable environment. Additionally, I enjoy collaborating in multidisciplinary teams, where communication and clarity are as important as technical skill."
